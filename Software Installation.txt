To run this application, you will need node.js and a server running MySQL with standard settings.

MySQL server requires a login of "root" and "pass", with a database schema name of "heroku_8a8e9bdedc4afce"
	- Use the two scripts provided to setup the schema and (hopefully) import the data
	- This can be modified in the source/config/default.json file

Go into the source folder and run "npm install" which will install all of the dependencies needed.

Once all dependencies are installed, run "npm run dev" which will start both the front and back end.
