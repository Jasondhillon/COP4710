# COP 4710 Project
This is a project for my Database Management Class where I make a full stack website for colleges to display student based organizations, allowing students to view events, create clubs, and join clubs. The database has three tiers of access, where one is a student that can see private events that the school provides, another is an admin which can create events for their club, and the last is the superAdmin which can create new universities and approve public/school events which students suggest, or deny the event.

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
